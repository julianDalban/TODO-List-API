Here's a practice project idea: Create a simple "Todo List API" that builds on the concepts you've learned but adds just a bit more complexity:
The API would manage a list of tasks where each task has:

A title
A description
A status (e.g., "pending", "in-progress", "completed")
A priority level (1-5)

This would practice the same concepts but add:

More complex Pydantic models with multiple fields
A list of items instead of a single string
Field validation for specific values (status can only be certain values, priority must be 1-5)

Basic structure would be:
python
class Task(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=100)
    description: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=1000)
    status: str = Field(..., pattern="^(pending|in-progress|completed)$")
    priority: int = Field(..., ge=1, le=5)

class TaskStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks: list[Task] = []
    
    # Methods to:
    # - add_task
    # - get_all_tasks
    # - update_task
    # - delete_task
    # - get_task_by_title
    
Endpoints would be:

GET /tasks (list all tasks)
GET /tasks/{title} (get specific task)
POST /tasks (create new task)
PUT /tasks/{title} (update task)
DELETE /tasks/{title} (delete task)

This builds on what you've learned but introduces:

Working with lists of objects
More complex validation rules
URL parameters (like {title})
More sophisticated data management
