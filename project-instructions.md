# API Development Learning Path: From Basics to Production

This comprehensive guide outlines your journey from understanding basic API concepts to building production-ready APIs using FastAPI. The path is structured into clear phases, each building upon previous knowledge while introducing new concepts and challenges.

## Current Status - Phase 1: Foundations
You have successfully completed the basic Todo API implementation which has given you a strong foundation in:
- Creating basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Understanding and implementing REST principles
- Working with Pydantic models for data validation
- Implementing path parameters
- Handling basic errors and exceptions

## Phase 2: Enhanced API Features

The next phase of development focuses on adding more sophisticated features to your Todo API. We'll enhance the existing functionality with advanced querying capabilities, proper pagination, and more robust error handling.

### Advanced Querying Implementation
Your API currently supports basic CRUD operations. We'll expand this to include filtering, sorting, and searching capabilities. Here's what you'll implement:

```python
@app.get("/tasks")
async def get_tasks(
    status: Optional[str] = None,
    priority: Optional[int] = None,
    sort_by: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    # Implementation will include:
    # - Filtering tasks by status and priority
    # - Sorting tasks by different fields
    # - Searching through task titles and descriptions
```

### Pagination Design
You'll learn about different pagination approaches and implement them:

Offset-based pagination:
```python
@app.get("/tasks")
async def get_tasks(
    skip: int = 0,
    limit: int = 10
):
    # Implement pagination logic
    # Return paginated results with metadata
```

Cursor-based pagination:
```python
@app.get("/tasks")
async def get_tasks(
    cursor: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: int = 10
):
    # Implement cursor-based pagination
    # More efficient for large datasets
```

### Enhanced Validation and Error Handling
We'll implement more sophisticated validation and error handling mechanisms:

```python
from fastapi import HTTPException, status
from typing import Optional, List

class CustomHTTPException(HTTPException):
    def __init__(
        self,
        status_code: int,
        detail: str,
        error_code: Optional[str] = None
    ):
        super().__init__(status_code=status_code, detail=detail)
        self.error_code = error_code
```

## Phase 3: Database Integration

Moving from in-memory storage to persistent storage is crucial for real-world applications. We'll integrate SQLAlchemy:

### Database Models
```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

class Task(Base):
    __tablename__ = "tasks"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    title = Column(String, unique=True, index=True)
    description = Column(String)
    status = Column(String)
    priority = Column(Integer)
    category_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("categories.id"))
    
    category = relationship("Category", back_populates="tasks")
```

## Phase 4: Authentication and Authorization

Security is crucial for production APIs. You'll implement:

- JWT authentication
- Role-based access control
- API key validation
- OAuth2 integration with common providers

## Phase 5: Production Readiness

The final phase prepares your API for production deployment:

### Logging Implementation
```python
import logging
from fastapi import Request
from typing import Callable

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@app.middleware("http")
async def log_requests(request: Request, call_next: Callable):
    logger.info(f"Request: {request.method} {request.url}")
    response = await call_next(request)
    return response
```

## Recommended Development Tools

Your development environment should include:
- Visual Studio Code with Python extensions
- Postman for API testing
- Docker for containerization
- Git for version control

│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── endpoints/
│   │   └── dependencies/
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── config.py
│   │   └── security.py

## Development Best Practices

1. Always work in feature branches
2. Write tests before implementing features (TDD)
3. Document your code thoroughly
4. Review your own code before committing
5. Keep your dependencies updated
6. Use type hints consistently
7. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

## Next Steps

1. Review the current Todo API implementation
2. Choose features from Phase 2 to implement first
3. Set up a proper development environment
4. Start implementing features incrementally
5. Write tests for each new feature
6. Document your progress
7. Share your code for review

Remember: The key to success is consistent practice and incremental progress. Don't try to implement everything at once. Take it step by step, ensure each feature works properly before moving to the next, and always write tests for your code.
